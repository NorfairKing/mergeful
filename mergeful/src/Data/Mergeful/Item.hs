-- | A way to synchronise an item with safe merge conflicts.
--
-- The item is "zero or one" value.
-- One could say that @Item a = Maybe a@ but there are so such types here.
-- This methaphor just serves as explanation
--
--
-- The setup is as follows:
--
-- * A central server is set up to synchronise with
-- * Each client synchronises with the central server, but never with eachother
--
--
-- = A client should operate as follows:
--
-- The clients starts with an 'initialClientItem'.
--
-- * The client produces a 'ItemSyncRequest' with 'makeItemSyncRequest'.
-- * The client sends that request to the central server and gets a 'ItemSyncResponse'.
-- * The client then updates its local store with 'mergeItemSyncResponseRaw' or 'mergeItemSyncResponseIgnoreProblems'.
--
--
-- = The central server should operate as follows:
--
-- The server starts with an 'initialServerItem'.
--
-- * The server accepts a 'ItemSyncRequest'.
-- * The server performs operations according to the functionality of 'processServerItemSync'.
-- * The server respons with a 'ItemSyncResponse'.
--
--
--
-- WARNING:
-- This whole approach can break down if a server resets its server times
-- or if a client syncs with two different servers using the same server times.
